Will be available, one day.
If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `casus` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/casus](https://hexdocs.pm/casus).

## Usage

There should be an explanation about how to configure the domain to use the Aggregate module.
In particular : 
 - the Aggregate.Module protocol
 - the Aggregate.Module.Event protocol
 - the Casus.Infra.EventNameTypeProvider behaviour
